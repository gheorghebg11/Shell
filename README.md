# Shell
Recognizing shell gas stations


For the interview:
Key features of this project:
- using Keras.utils.Sequence which has many advantages.
  - From the Keras documentation: Sequence are a safer way to do multiprocessing. This structure guarantees that the network will only train once on each sample per epoch which is not the case with generators.
  - Most Keras tutorials use the ImageDataGenerator class to generate batch and do image augmentation. But it doesnâ€™t leave much room for customization and it is not fast enough. (although it would be fine for this small project...)

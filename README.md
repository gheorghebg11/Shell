# Shell
Recognizing shell gas stations

TODO:
- Enlarge the data set! --> add more categories
- hyperparam tuning : batch_size, factorreduceLR, LR, architecture, at padding min_ratio, crop dimensions, 
- save tensorboard somehow + integrate in pres (it resets after each fold) - can ask if I want to continue. If fail just keep the graph and plot them
- the padding is done with repeating the image. Makes sense ??? compare with and without. Use cv2.BORDER_CONSTANT if no.
- create cell to load a pretrained model for the pres
- try TPU
- do a presentation from the notebook!


Slideshow:
- after its made, under Reveal.initialize({     .... under transition: ..., add the followin: width: 1900, height:900,

Discussion for pres:
